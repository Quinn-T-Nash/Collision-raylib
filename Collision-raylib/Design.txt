Using the Raylib API libary, implement 2 collison algorithms for 2d rigid body shapes

Algorithms
	SAT
	GJK

Basic 2D primative Shapes to start with
	Triangle
	Square
	Circle


Classes


SAT (non rounded)
	1 - The only input we need from the shape is the vertices of the shape



GJK (non rounded)
	1 - Again the only input we need is the vertices of the shape

Shape
	We need to know all the vertices of the shape
